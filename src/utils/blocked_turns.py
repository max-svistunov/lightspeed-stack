"""The mark of a turn a shield blocked (LCORE-3788).

A turn a shield blocked is stored in the conversation, so that the history a
client reads is complete. It must not reach the model again. Conversation
compaction rebuilds the model's context from the stored items, so a blocked
text that is replayed or summarized there was not blocked, only delayed by one
turn.

A conversation item has no field for metadata, so the mark is the item id: the
messages of a blocked turn are stored under an id that starts with
``BLOCKED_ITEM_ID_PREFIX``. OGX keeps an id the caller supplies. The ids it
generates itself are ``msg_`` followed by hexadecimal digits or a UUID, so they
never start with the prefix.

Only turns stored with the mark are recognized. A blocked turn stored before
the mark existed looks like any other turn.
